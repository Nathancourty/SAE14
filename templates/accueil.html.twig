        <h2>personal information</h2>
        <p>first name:Nathan<br>
        Name:COURTY<br>
        university email address: nathan.courty@etu.univ-st-etienne.fr</p>
        <h2>presentation</h2>
        <p>I am currently in BUT (university bachelors of technology) in the network and telecommunications department<br>
            I joined this training because in high school, I loved working on electricity laws and telecommunications which is an essential part of the B.U.T<br>
            and I also worked on networks in the Engineering Science specialty<br>
            I am doing this GOAL with a view to entering an engineering school afterwards, and doing this course on a work-study basis, that's why I chose to do a GOAL and not a preparatory class for the Grandes Ecoles
            <br>I also chose this training instead of the preparatory class because I preferred to do the B.U.T program, more focused on the proffessional than the general</p>
